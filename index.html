    <p>Fuck Beta</p>
    <p>On February 5, 2014, Slashdot announced through a javascript popup that they are starting to "move in to" the new Slashdot Beta design.</p>
    <p>Slashdot Beta is a trend-following attempt to give Slashdot a fresh look, an approach that has led to less space for text and an abandonment of the traditional Slashdot look. Much worse than that, Slashdot Beta fundamentally breaks the classic Slashdot discussion and moderation system.</p>
    <p>We should boycott slashdot entirely during the week of Feb 10 to Feb 17 and tell Dice how we feel about the beta website.</p>
